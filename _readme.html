	It includes two build configurations:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Debug - dynamically linked debugging version meant to be used while developing the project.</li>
	<li>Release - statically linked optimized version. You do not need to distribute any DLLs with this build.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If you upgrade Allegro after using this template, then you will need to update the names of the Allegro
	libraries in your project's linker settings. e.g., You'll need to change 5.0.0 to 5.0.1 for both the debug
	and release configurations. (It is assumed you will be using the same folder location for updated Allegro versions.)
